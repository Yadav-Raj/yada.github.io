											<h3>The Result</h3>
											<p>The bot was able to predict the matches correctly almost 70% of the times with the range
												going from 43% accuracy to 87% accuracy.</p>

											<h3>To implement my improvement</h3>
											<p>To implement the improvements that the data from my project points towards, we could either scrape transfer market websites, which would be difficult as all of them are based on opinions anyways and football experts have a notoriously bad reputation for getting transfer ratings wrong. </p>
												<ul class="actions">

										<h3>The process and Improvements</h3>
										<p>The process started with scrolling through and scrapping from online databases that stored the results of each team from the last three years in the English Premier League, which is the most watched soccer league in the world.</p>
										<p>The bot worked best with more stable teams in terms of their squad. The teams that did not have any significant changes to their squads in terms of both addition and removal, saw almost 90% accuracy in their scores. In this area the bot performed significantly well. </p>
										<p>Where the bot lacked was predicting the results of teams that had a lot of activity, especially with teams that spent a lot of money to acquire marquee players. The bot would have performed better if we had a number to rate the transfer activity of each team but that would also give rise to some arbitrarity.</p>
										<h3>The tech stack</h3>
										<p>The following technologies were used for creating this project:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Python.</li>
											<li>Jupyter Notebook.</li>
											<li>Pandas Package.</li>
											<li>Microsoft Excel.</li>
											<li>Tableau Visualization.</li>
										</ul>
